    <p class=p1>The orchid family (Orchidaceae) is the second largest family of flowering plants, with about 880 genera and some 26,000 species distributed nearly worldwide. Orchids are perennial herbs and feature unusual bilaterally symmetric flowers, with masses of pollen known as pollinia, and tiny, dustlike seeds. Many are grown as ornamentals for their showy flowers, and several are of economic importance as the source of the flavouring vanilla. The following is a list of some of the major genera and species in the family Orchidaceae, arranged alphabetically by common name or genus.</p>

    <p class=p2>KEY CHARACTERISTICS
        Orchids have specialized, often showy flowers with colors and structures that attract insect pollinators. The flowers have a modified petal called a labellum that appears larger and/or more ornamented that the other petals and sepals. It is usually positioned as the lowermost petal. Orchids are easiest to tell apart by their flowers, so try to observe a mature, flowering plant. Notice whether the leaves all grow at the base of the plant, or whether some grow on the stem. Some orchids produce leaves with green-and-white or spotted color patterns.</p>
