   <p class="paragraph2">According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.</p> 
    
    <p>CIA Director Porter Goss lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as: </p> 
    
    <ul>
     <li>the Cold War</li>
     <li>the civil-rights movement </li>
     <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
    </ul>
